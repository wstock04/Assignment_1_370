Deep Anesthesia Patient Breathing Circuit and Ventilator Software

Project Overview:

This project focuses on designing a high-level UML use case diagram for software that controls a deep anesthesia patient breathing circuit and ventilator. The ventilator assists with breathing during anesthesia, delivering fresh gases to the patient and removing waste gases. Since normal breathing is impossible when a patient is paralyzed under anesthesia, this software is essential to ensure proper gas delivery and management.
Software Scope

The software is responsible for:

- Controlling the delivery and removal of mixed gases to the patient.
- Continuously monitoring sensors and valves throughout the system.
- Configuring operational and alarm limits (oxygen concentration, CO2 concentration, volume flow, etc.).
- Indirectly measuring patient status and notifying medical personnel of dangerous conditions.
- Allowing user input through a small terminal with a screen and dial/keypad.

UML Use Case Diagram:

The project includes a top-level UML use case diagram that outlines the major functionalities of the system and its actors. The diagram focuses on the core aspects of the softwareâ€™s operation, without delving into the lower-level details.
